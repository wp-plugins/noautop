== Description ==

Adds the function "the_content_noautop" which doesn't include a paragraph tag automatically with the post content.

Use the_content_noautop(); instead of the_content(); in the loop when you don't want an automatic paragraph tag in your blog. This could be useful in many advanced formatting situations.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.

2. Go to the Plugins page and activate the plugin.

3. When needed, replace the instance of "the_content();" inside of your theme files with "the_content_noautop();" This will allow you to control all aspects of styling the output text within your theme.
